        <p>
            The University Institutes of Technology in France are spread over the whole territory and number 115,
                which ensures a strong anchoring in the local and regional economic environment.
                Meetings between department directors of IUTs ensure national consistency in teaching. </br></br>
            The IUT has a university education quality recognized and acclaimed by companies for more than 40 years,
                thanks to the implementation of programs adapted to professional reality and to creation
                of diplomas responding to the emergence of new professions. </br>
            As a result, the IUTs in France train students in IT and teamwork in order to integrate them
                in professional life. They thus offer training on a human scale, supervised
                by available teachers, as well as by experienced professionals who
                provide students with practical and concrete experience in IT professions. </br>
                In addition to these targeted teaching, we add general lessons
                (Mathematics, Economics and Management, English and Communication, ...) </br></br>
            The evaluation is made not only on theory but also on stakes
                in situation, via projects and an internship in a company, allowing to validate the
                knowledge and skills acquired during the training. </br>
            This covers most sectors (secondary and tertiary)
                and offering the collaboration of professionals are the strength and success of IUT,
                and allow students to find a job within 6
                months following the award of the diploma. </br></br>
            This diversification of diplomas and training leads to the implementation of different teaching methods,
                which are suitable for a larger number of students and professionals wishing
                resume studies or carry out a validation of acquired experience (VAE). <br></br>
            In addition, IUTs, in partnership with foreign universities,
                offer study abroad pursuits, as well as internships. </p>
